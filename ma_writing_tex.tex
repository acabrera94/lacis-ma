Social movement studies have a long-standing tradition of studying
conflict, social change, and what some scholars contentious politics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcadam2004}{\textbf{mcadam2004?}}).

However, with the recent protests located in the Global North have shown
that

This article uses a quantitative methodology based on the
\href{https://www.gesis.org/en/issp/modules/issp-modules-by-topic/citizenship/2014}{Social
Survey Programme 2014 - Citizenship II (ISSP)}\footnote{By the time this
  article has been written, another wave of the same thematic survey is
  under development and expected to fully realese in 2025.} (\emph{N} =
49.087). This dataset applies a similar\footnote{It is a similar
  questionary because the survey don't apply the exact same questions in
  every country. However, the questions are prepared to grasp and
  collect the same dimensions for every question applied.} questionnaire
in every country in which it is applied. The sampling procedure differs
for each country: in some countries, partly simple random samples were
applied, whereas in others, partly multistage stratified random samples.
The data was collected in two ways. The first one was through interviews
(face-to-face, Computer Assisted Personal interviews, or completed on
the telephone) or Self-administered questionnaires (Computer Assisted
self-interviews or Computer-Assisted web interviews). The analysis is
mostly applied to individuals that are 18 years or more with some
exceptions\footnote{According to the ISSP, the exceptions were countries
  such as Finland, were individuals between 15 and 75 were surveyed,
  Japan, were 16 years old and older were surveyed, South Africa, were
  the respondents were 16 years or more, and Sweden, were the
  individuals were between 17 and 79 years old.}. After processing the
dataset, the sample was reduced to 33.582 individuals nested in 34
countries.

The hypotheses that led this study were tested by calculating OLS.
According to Linear regressions are the ``\emph{best linear
approximation of the relationship}'' between two variables.

As the literature says, Linear Models are appropriate when we seek
{[}\ldots.{]}. In this case, since we are testing the effect that class
structure has on the working class participation in collective action
activities, other models that provide a better understanding of
probability, such as Logistic and Logit, aren't required. To put it in
other words, since we are not measuring the \emph{probability} that the
working class has to undertake collective action activities but the
\emph{influence} that class structure itself has on
