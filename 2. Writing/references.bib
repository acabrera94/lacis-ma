  abstract = {The analysis of the interplay of capitalism and politics\textemdash in other words, political economy\textemdash played an extremely important role in many of the seminal, English-language studies of social movements and revolutions written by social scientists during the 1970s and 1980s (e.g., Paige 1975; Schwartz 1976; Piven \& Cloward 1977; McAdam 1999). These studies had the effect of radically reorienting the academic study of movements, revolutions, and political conflict generally. The field moved away from primarily psychological and social-psychological treatments of political protest\textemdash studies that often cast a very negative light on protest\textemdash to more sympathetic analyses that emphasized the importance of resources, power, solidarities, and opportunities for movements. But all this is now common wisdom among students of movements. What has been largely forgotten is that these same studies tended to emphasize the effects of capitalism on movements. The dynamics of capitalism figure prominently in these studies, sometimes constraining and sometimes inciting or enabling disruptive collective action. By capitalism, these authors generally mean a mode of production in which a class that owns the means of production (capitalists) employs a class that must sell its labor power in exchange for a wage or salary (workers), and in which market competition among capitalists leads them to reinvest part of the surplus (or profits) in the production process (i.e., capital accumulation). The dynamics of capitalism that these authors emphasize include processes directly linked to market competition and capital accumulation, especially the proletarianization (or commodification) of labor, the commodification of productive forces generally, the concentration and centralization of capital, and periodic crises.},

  abstract = {Why do societies today distribute political power more equally than before? Most scholars believe that this transition is explained by the rise of capitalism but have long disagreed about why it mattered. The author argues that dominant models fail to capture why capitalist development helps key actors win what they seek. Drawing on comparative and historical work, the author introduces a model of the democratic transition that centers on the concept of disruptive capacity. He collects data on employment structures for much of the modern period to study democratization over the same period. In cross-national regressions, the author finds evidence that the disruptive capacity of nonelites drives democratic gains, and the finding that landlord capacity stymies it is reproduced. Counterfactual exercises show that slightly more than half of the democracy gap between the developing and developed world can be explained by the fact that late development bolstered landlords while handicapping nonelites.},

  abstract = {This chapter explores the evolving relationship between social class and social mobilization, both as objects of study and categories of analysis. Starting with a historical account of how class has served as a basis for mobilization, as well as a concept for understanding it, the analysis then discusses the evolution of social class and social mobilization, which grew more distant just as theories of social mobilization became more systematized. It draws on protest and strike data to explore the size and overlap between these ``old'' and ``new'' movements at the time that social movement theories were emerging. The chapter then examines how social class and social mobilization are coming together again as the nature and scope of social movement scholarship changes. It concludes with an assessment of key questions and unresolved debates around the study of social class and social movements.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on changing patterns in labor mobilization in the shadow of the Great Recession. While the Great Recession has produced a return of the movements in the streets and the squares of many European countries, labor has mobilized in very different forms in different countries and circumstances. During the crisis, protests took forms resonant with Polanyi-like countermovements but also with Wallerstein-like antisystemic movements, with the latter spreading especially where the disruption of the quotidian was stronger. The article addresses anti-austerity protests, with particular attention to the development of the labor movements in light of the 2008 financial crisis, looking at some quantitative indicators of unions' strength/weakness and industrial conflict in European countries, but also at qualitative evidence on the role unions have played in the struggles against austerity and increasing inequalities, particularly in the European periphery that suffered the recession's consequences.},
