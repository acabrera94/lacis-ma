  abstract = {The analysis of the interplay of capitalism and politics\textemdash in other words, political economy\textemdash played an extremely important role in many of the seminal, English-language studies of social movements and revolutions written by social scientists during the 1970s and 1980s (e.g., Paige 1975; Schwartz 1976; Piven \& Cloward 1977; McAdam 1999). These studies had the effect of radically reorienting the academic study of movements, revolutions, and political conflict generally. The field moved away from primarily psychological and social-psychological treatments of political protest\textemdash studies that often cast a very negative light on protest\textemdash to more sympathetic analyses that emphasized the importance of resources, power, solidarities, and opportunities for movements. But all this is now common wisdom among students of movements. What has been largely forgotten is that these same studies tended to emphasize the effects of capitalism on movements. The dynamics of capitalism figure prominently in these studies, sometimes constraining and sometimes inciting or enabling disruptive collective action. By capitalism, these authors generally mean a mode of production in which a class that owns the means of production (capitalists) employs a class that must sell its labor power in exchange for a wage or salary (workers), and in which market competition among capitalists leads them to reinvest part of the surplus (or profits) in the production process (i.e., capital accumulation). The dynamics of capitalism that these authors emphasize include processes directly linked to market competition and capital accumulation, especially the proletarianization (or commodification) of labor, the commodification of productive forces generally, the concentration and centralization of capital, and periodic crises.},

  abstract = {Why do societies today distribute political power more equally than before? Most scholars believe that this transition is explained by the rise of capitalism but have long disagreed about why it mattered. The author argues that dominant models fail to capture why capitalist development helps key actors win what they seek. Drawing on comparative and historical work, the author introduces a model of the democratic transition that centers on the concept of disruptive capacity. He collects data on employment structures for much of the modern period to study democratization over the same period. In cross-national regressions, the author finds evidence that the disruptive capacity of nonelites drives democratic gains, and the finding that landlord capacity stymies it is reproduced. Counterfactual exercises show that slightly more than half of the democracy gap between the developing and developed world can be explained by the fact that late development bolstered landlords while handicapping nonelites.},

Starting with a historical account of how class has served as a basis for mobilization, as well as a concept for understanding it, the analysis then discusses the evolution of social class and social mobilization, which grew more distant just as theories of social mobilization became more systematized. It draws on protest and strike data to explore the size and overlap between these ``old'' and ``new'' movements at the time that social movement theories were emerging. The chapter then examines how social class and social mobilization are coming together again as the nature and scope of social movement scholarship changes. It concludes with an assessment of key questions and unresolved debates around the study of social class and social movements.},

While the Great Recession has produced a return of the movements in the streets and the squares of many European countries, labor has mobilized in very different forms in different countries and circumstances. During the crisis, protests took forms resonant with Polanyi-like countermovements but also with Wallerstein-like antisystemic movements, with the latter spreading especially where the disruption of the quotidian was stronger. The article addresses anti-austerity protests, with particular attention to the development of the labor movements in light of the 2008 financial crisis, looking at some quantitative indicators of unions' strength/weakness and industrial conflict in European countries, but also at qualitative evidence on the role unions have played in the struggles against austerity and increasing inequalities, particularly in the European periphery that suffered the recession's consequences.},

Not only are they the first generation of ``digital natives,'' but, although they are more educated than any previous U.S. generation, they face a labor market in which precarity is increasingly the norm. And despite proclamations to the contrary, they confront persistent racial and gender disparities, discrimination against sexual minorities, and widening class inequality\textemdash all of which they understand in the framework of ``intersectionality.'' This address analyzes the four largest social movements spearheaded by college-educated Millennials: the young undocumented immigrant ``Dreamers,'' the 2011 Occupy Wall Street uprising, the campus movement protesting sexual assault, and the Black Lives Matter movement. All four reflect the distinctive historical experience of the Millennial generation, but they vary along two cross-cutting dimensions: (1) the social characteristics of activists and leaders, and (2) the dominant modes of organization and strategic repertoires.},

This introductory article notes that two streams of mobilization can be distinguished in terms of the specific grievances they express, and the socioeconomic and political contexts in which they have emerged. The article argues, however, that despite these differences both threads find their antecedents in the increasing and widespread social and economic levels of inequality, which requires social movements theories to `bring political economy back' in the analysis of mobilization. It is further argued that the various occupy movements that have emerged since 2011 constitute diverse manifestations of a new international cycle of contention. With its innovative and distinctive traits in terms of diffusion, coordination, action repertoires, frames, and types of activism, this new cycle seeks to both transform the economic system to provide greater equality, opportunities, and personal fulfillment and, simultaneously, to democratize power in more participatory ways.},

  abstract = {We examine the relationship between material deprivation and different types of responses to economic crises by civil society actors. We are interested in understanding whether material deprivation has an effect on civil society reactions to the crisis and whether political opportunity factors contribute to this relationship. In particular, we wish to ascertain if the effect of material deprivation is moderated by perceptions of political stability, on one hand, and of the effectiveness of government, on the other. Our results show that the effect of material deprivation on various aspects of responses to the crisis varies depending on the perceptions of the political environment. This suggests that perceptions of political stability and government effectiveness feed into the interpretation of present conditions. Therefore, perceptions of political stability and government effectiveness act as signals leading material deprivation to become politicized as a grievance.

  abstract = {Social movement scholars have rarely paid attention to the transformations of capitalism as factors of social movement formation processes. This paper makes two different but complementary contributions. First, we provide a macro-social theory that connects the emergence of social movements to the capital circuit in order to embed social movement formation processes into the structural dynamics of capitalism. Exploring such dynamics is helpful to the understanding of social movements if one only looks at them by highlighting their socio-political\textemdash and not only merely economic\textemdash nature. Secondly, we show how and to what extent some institutional transformations involving the politics of advanced capitalist societies have been affected by the capital circuit and vice versa. More notably, we argue that these transformations have given rise to a political field centered on the ambivalence between two poles, namely, a regressive-oligarchic and a participative-mobilizing one, which is the domain of populist politics today.},

Marx points to the small tenants in France as a famous example of a class not capable of developing a collective consciousness of itself and therefore being unable to act collectively. He referred to them as a ``sack of potatoes.'' Regarding the industrial worker, Marx was much more optimistic because of the intersection of two critical factors: (i) the presumed centrality of the conflict this emerging class would address; and (ii) the social conditions that link the proletarian workers via their concentration in the industrial workplace and the urban housing conditions which make communication and strong relationships among them more probable.},

Analysing the changing configuration of labour markets, structural insecurity, labour movements and welfare states, this essay tries to revive the empirical validity of the notion of working class in a Scandinavian context. As a starting point I discuss how changing occupational patterns and state intervention transformed the basic class structure of the three Scandinavian countries Denmark, Sweden and Norway. This led to new trends in consumption, saving and the way ordinary people coped with social insecurity. These developments made heavy demands on the labour movement, which was challenged from within by renewed grassroots activity, i. e. social movement unionism, and from without by new social movements. Recently the Scandinavian countries were exposed to globalisation. The result was a further division of the working class and new organisational and political cleavage structures.},

This article argues that the reverse-J curve is itself the result of two distinct kinds of effects of workers' power on capitalists' interests: one, a negative effect, in which workers' power undermines the capacity of capitalists to unilaterally make various kinds of decisions, and the second, a positive effect, in which workers' power helps capitalists solve the various kinds of collective action problems they face.},

Then, turning to the industrial arena, we review the determinants of unionism and critically consider arguments about the conservative impact of formal organization on worker insurgency. Next we survey recent contributions by labor historians, whose work challenges many of the received sociological understandings of organized labor's development. Finally, we review some promising areas of inquiry within sociology, pointing in particular to research on social movements, organizational environments, and workers' consciousness.},

I outline state transformations that occurred in the context of conflict between civil rights activists and organized labor over the definition of economic justice.

Subsequently, a breakaway tradition redefined the central problem, radically narrowing the scope of interest to the process of mobilization\textemdash how social groups, whoever they are and whatever their aims, marshal resources, recruit adherents, and navigate political environments in order to grow and succeed. Critics would later insist that the construction of meaning, the formation of collective identities, and the stimulation and amplification of emotions play vital and neglected roles in mobilization, but these alternatives did not challenge the narrowed construction of the problem itself. The resulting subfield has largely abandoned the quest to explain variation in the political orientation of movements. Researchers in related fields\textemdash on revolution, unions, and ethnic mobilization\textemdash have retained an interest in explaining political orientation, although they often view it primarily as a by-product of mobilization. Reviving theories about the impact of social structure on movement political orientation will require integrating insights from research on related but widely scattered subjects.},

  abstract = {This article considers the nature of activism and revolutionary process in the twenty-first century by examining some of the dilemmas involved in Egypt's ongoing process of transformation. Over the course of only a couple of weeks Egyptian activists who, for over a decade, had protested against Mubarak and his neoliberal policies, found themselves transformed from protestors, demonstrators and strikers, members of loosely structured networks, to the status of `revolutionaries'. These newly-minted revolutionaries were suddenly expected either to capture or renegotiate state power, provide a vision for the future emanating from the iconic image of Tahrir Square and transform both polity and society. The article argues that the characteristics of New Social Movements (NSMs), especially the absence of sustainable organizational structures, although well suited to the phase of mass protests in the lead-up to the ousting of Mubarak, now pose one of the main challenges to the prospects of genuine revolutionary change in the post-Mubarak era.},
